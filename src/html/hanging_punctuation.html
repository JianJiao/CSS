		If you need to read or clone all of a modelâ€™s data attributes, use its toJSON() method. This method returns a copy of the attributes as an object (not a JSON string despite its name). (When JSON.stringify() is passed an object with a toJSON() method, it stringifies the return value of toJSON() instead of the original object. The examples in the previous section took advantage of this feature when they called JSON.stringify() to log model instances.)
